# Twitter Simulation in Java

## ðŸ“– Description

This project is a simple **console-based Twitter simulation** built in Java.  
Users can:
- **Post tweets** (up to 60 characters each),
- **Store up to 10 tweets per user**,
- **Retrieve and view all tweets** for a specific username, along with **timestamps**.

Itâ€™s a small and clean project to practice Java fundamentals like:
- `HashMap`, `ArrayList`
- Classes and objects
- `Scanner` for user input
- `LocalDateTime` for timestamps
- Menu-driven programming.

Once you start the program, you'll see a simple menu:

```
1. Add Tweet
2. Get Tweets of a User
3. Exit
```

- **Option 1:**  
  Enter a username and your tweet (max 60 characters).  
  A timestamp will be added automatically.
